# RoomHelper 3000

A webapp to manage a class of students in a computer lab.

- shows where the students are sitting (from the teacher’s and the students’ perspective)
- lets the students indicate they need help, are done with the current task, or have an answer to the question being asked
- randomly chooses students from the entire class, or from just those who have indicated they have an answer
- shows the students the current task, or other message from the teacher
- allows the students to chat with each other (when the teacher permits it)
