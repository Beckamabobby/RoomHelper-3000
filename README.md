# RoomHelper 3000

A webapp to manage a class of students in a computer lab.

- shows where the students are sitting (from the teacher’s and the students’ perspective)
- lets the students indicate they need help, are done with the current task, or have an answer to the question being asked
- randomly chooses students from the entire class, or from just those who have indicated they have an answer
- shows the students the current task, or other message from the teacher
- allows the students to chat with each other (when the teacher permits it)

Feature ideas:

- A button for the teacher to ring a bell on all clients,
to regain student attention
- Chat:
    - Delete all messages from a person
    - Disable chat for a person
- Make it easier to help students in order of them checking the box. Maybe a special marking for whoever is next.
- Remove confusion where students think they have to
push Set when they change checkbox settings
- Quick polls (yes/no, multiple choice, real number range)
- April Fools skylarking
